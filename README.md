We provide the code for all scheduling algorithms mentioned in our neurips 2025 paper. Here is a quick guide:

For our MC-SF algorithm on the synthetic data, you can find the algorithm in MC-SF_synthetic.py

For the hindsight optimal algorithm by solving the integer programming on the synthetic data, you can find the algorithm in Hindsight_IP.py

For the real experiments:

You can find the algorithm MC-SF in MC-SF.py

You can find the algorithm MC-Benchmark in MC-Benchmark.py

You can find the alpha-greedy algorithm in alpha-greedy.py

You can find the alpha-protection, beta-clearing algorithm in alpha-beta.py
